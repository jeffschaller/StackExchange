# TODO
# - once nodes are settled, use headlabel/taillabel/label to put labels in best places
# see also: labeldistance

# DONE
# - color the close-type lines & boxes
# 	available colors: http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/colors.html
# - change all nodes to be "quoted more readable"
# - make sure there are no more intermediate decision nodes
# - yellow is too hard to read
# - bisque is too hard to read
# - use dotted & dashed lines -- maybe for Skip & Leave Open?
# -- dotted for Skip
# -- dashed for Want to Leave Open
# make every node have spaces "in it like this"
# credit to https://stackoverflow.com/q/2649781/4957508 for using nodesep to
#   space the chart out vertically a bit

# close types:
#* (1) duplicate
#* (7) off-topic: norepro, xpost, learning, other-meta, other-SO, other-their-custom, other-my-custom
#* (1) unclear
#* (1) broad
#* (1) opinion-based
####
#* (1) skip
#* (2) edit, leave open
